# tab storage

Tab storage is an extension for Adobe Acrobat that allows storing and retrieving the program's state regarding open tabs.

It adds three new items inside the Window Menu. The first one, named "Save Tabs", stores information about the open tabs (file opened, page number, visible part of the page etc.). The second one, named "Open Tabs", retrieves the previously stored information and opens tabs as described. Finally, there is an item named "Opening Tabs on Startup" which enables/disables opening the stored tabs when the program starts.

To make this extension work just place the file tab_storage.js inside the folder Acrobat/Javascripts/ in Acrobat's installation folder.
